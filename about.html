			She grew up on a farm at Great Ayton, attending the village school, and at 17 was apprenticed to a
			shopkeeper at Staithes. After eighteen months, with the consent of all concerned, she gave this up for a
			more enticing apprenticeship of three years under John Walker, a Quaker coal-shipper of Whitby. Here she
			made some headway with mathematics and navigation and served two years before the mast in the Baltic trade.
			In 1755 Walker offered him a command, but instead Cook joined H.M.S. Eagle and within a month was master's
			mate. After two years on the Channel service, she was promoted master of the Pembroke, and in 1758 crossed
			the Atlantic in her and took part in the siege of Louisburg and the survey of the St Lawrence River that led
			to the capture of Quebec. Transferred to the Northumberland, she began surveying the coasts of Nova Scotia
			and Newfoundland, in the winter months at Halifax reading solidly in his chosen subjects.

		<p>She took a job as a receptionist for Clinton Aviation Company in Denver, Colorado to pay for her
			instruction.[8] She worked there as a flight instructor after obtaining additional certificates as a
			commercial pilot and flight instructor, and instrument and multiengine ratings.[12] She worked extra
			maintenance flights, such as delivering airplane parts or planes, in order to build her hours. She also flew
			with a reporter to provide traffic reports.

			She worked in her spare time on various hobbies and inventions, which included an improved traffic
			stoplight and a tablet that would dissolve in water to create a carbonated drink.
			Among the few who knew of her inventiveness was aviation tycoon Howard Hughes. She suggested he change the
			rather square design of his aero planes (which she thought looked too slow) to a more streamlined shape,
			based on pictures of the fastest birds and fish she could find. She discussed her relationship with Hughes
			during an interview, saying that while they dated, she actively supported her "tinkering" hobbies. She put
			his team of scientists and engineers at her disposal, saying they would do or make anything she asked for.
