		<h1>Code On Demand - Introduction</h1>
		<p>
		<h2>Concept Of Code On Demand</h2>
		</p>
		<p>
			In distributed computing, code on demand is any technology that sends executable software code from a server
			computer to a client computer upon request from the client's software.

		</p>
		<p>The program code lies inactive on a web server until a user (client) requests a web page that contains a
			link to the code using the client's web browser. Upon this request, the web page and the program are
			transported to the user's machine using HTTP. When the page is displayed, the code is started in the browser
			and executes locally, inside the user's computer until it is stopped (e.g., by the user leaving the web
			page).<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_on_demand">[Details]</a></p>

				It was initially realised using Java applets (now deprecated),
				JavaScript, Adobe’s FlashPlayer and ActionScript, and more recently is implemented using
				WebAssembly.

			<p>Applets are java programs that run inside a browser. They share the memory, resources and the process
				allocated to the browser and are not allocated anything exclusively on the machine.
				They are made for better user interaction.
			</p>
			<p>Applets are intended to be small programs and can be downloaded on demand. They are typically used to
				display data provided by the server, handle user input, or provide simple functions, such as a loan
				calculator, that execute locally, rather than on the server.
			</p>
			<p>
				An Applet is a subclass of java.applet.Applet package. It doesn’t consist of a main method unlike a Java
				application.Different states that an applet experiences between its object creation and object removal
				is known as Applet Life Cycle. There exists 5 states represented by 5 methods.These methods are known as
				"callback methods" as they are called automatically by the browser whenever required for the smooth
				execution of the applet.

			<p>Adobe Flash Player is computer software for content created on the Adobe Flash platform. </p>


			<p>Back in old days, websites uses it to display advanced contents like highly dynamic contents, videos,
				application or game with reasonable perfomance. which is now majorly replaced by HTML5 Media. Some
				browsers still support it though, but they usually need to be enabled first or need permissions to be
				activated.
			</p>
			<p>It’s authoring tool, Adobe Flash which is now renamed to Adobe Animate since CC 2015, still became an
				animation industry standard for 2D animation. Though looks like they also slowly neglected their own web
				runtime for HTML5 Canvas / WebGL which is more optimized and more used these days.

			<p>
				ActionScript is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that is designed specifically for Web site
				animation. Originally released with Macromedia Flash 4 and enhanced for Flash 5, ActionScript is a
				sophisticated version of the script language introduced in Flash 3.
			</p>
			<p>
				ActionScript makes it possible for developers to create onscreen environments (such as games, tutorials,
				and
				e-commerce applications) that can respond to user input through the keyboard or mouse. ActionScript is
				an
				event-based language: just as is the case in real life, actions are triggered by events.<a

			<p>
				Javascript gives us the ability to allow our users to interact with the webpage. When we start
				incorporating
				Javascript the web pages become more than a vessel for displaying text and media, the user’s engagement
				increases because they have more command over the content. This code allows us to create buttons and
				menus
				that change when the mouse hovers over them, or even gives us the capacity to create users and further
				personalize their experience with the website.
			</p>
			<p>
				Javascript, much like Internal and External CSS, needs to be contained within a special tag, this one is
				called a ‘script’ tag. You should also position it underneath the data that you want it to affect.

		<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>

		<h3>Pros</h3>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li>It can add functionality to a deployed client and improves extensibility and configurability;
			</li>
			<li>it is better when code can adapt its actions to the client's environment and interact with the user
				locally rather than remotely. Good users perceive performance and efficiency.
			</li>
			<li>It lacks simplicity due to the need to manage the evaluation environment but can be compensated in some
				cases by simplifying static client functionality.</li>
			<li>It improves the scalability of the server as the server offloads work to the client that would otherwise
				consume the server's resource</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<h3>Cons</h3>
		<p>Like the remote evaluation style, the most significant limitation is the lack of visibility since the server
			sends code instead of simple data. The lack of visibility can lead to obvious deployment problems if the
			client cannot trust the server.</p>
