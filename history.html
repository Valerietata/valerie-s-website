		<h2>1990s</h2>
		<p> The early to mid-1990s, COD thrives by some of the software that emerged at the time.</p>
		<p>
			In September 1995, a Netscape programmer named Brandan Eich developed a new scripting language in just 10
			days. It was originally named Mocha, but quickly became known as LiveScript and, later, JavaScript.
		</p>

		<p>JavaScript lets you add functionality and behaviors to your website, allowing your website’s visitors to
			interact with content in many imaginative ways.

		<p>Sun Microsystems introduced Java applets in 1995.In the early days of the internet, applets were commonly
			used to create interactive buttons, check boxes, forms and other small animations on websites. To
			accommodate the use of applets, HTML4 included an applet tag. The tag invoked a Java virtual machine (JVM)
			plugged into the browser and was accompanied by <parameters> that specified where and how the applet should
				display on the webpage.

		<p>Flash Player was originally released by FutureWave under the name FutureSplash Player, it was renamed to
			Flash Player after Macromedia acquired FutureWave. It can run from a web browser as a browser plug-in or on
			supported mobile devices.

		<h2>Now Days</h2>
		<p>COD implementation has altered in recent years.</p>
		<p>Java applets often failed to provide much extra functionality compared to alternatives like JavaScript,
			HTML5, Flash and JavaFX. Flash, in particular, emerged as a strong competitor to Java applets when it came
			to the creation of animations, and both JavaScript and HTML5 have been considered superior in terms of
			browser support.</p>
		<p>Thus, beginning in 2013, major web browsers began to phase out support for the underlying technology applets
			used to run, with applets becoming completely unable to be run by 2015–2017. Java applets were deprecated by
			Java 9 in 2017.

		</p>
		<p>Because of these many security vulnerabilities, Adobe was required to issue updates to Flash Player often.
			(See the many posts on the Intego Mac Security Blog about Flash Player security updates.) By 2011, Flash
			Player was no longer included with Mac OS X, and users had to download it to view Flash content on the web.
			Many were duped by websites telling them that they needed Flash Player to view content: they would download
			what they thought were legitimate Flash Player installers, only to find that malware had infected their
			Macs.

		<p>In 2017, Adobe announced that Flash would reach the end of its life on December 31, 2020. This warning, two
			and a half years before the cutoff date, gave developers plenty of time to change their technologies, but by
			then, many steps had already been taken to eliminate it.

		<p>From its slightly rocky start, JavaScript has risen to be the most popular programming language in the world.
			According to GitHub’s 2018 Octoverse report, there are more JavaScript code repositories than any other
			language—and that number is steadily on the rise.
